  <h1>Mahεirεma</h1>
</div>

The application is under development and is gradually approaching the final stage of the first working version

This application is your assistant in everyday life, namely, one of its pleasant parts is cooking and eating

Have you ever wondered: _“What should I cook today,”_ or could your loved ones ask you a similar question? It would seem that you have the ingredients in stock, and you can cook some dishes from them, but ... You don't know what exactly you want.
Searching cookbooks for recipes that you could cook with the ingredients you have is a long and tedious task.
The cooking process becomes much easier when there is a handy tool at hand that will do the search for recipes for the available ingredients for you!

Oh yes, **Mahεirεma** comes to your rescue! All you have to do is enter the ingredients you have, and request a list of recipes in the app

_I really hope that my application will help you in cooking!_
